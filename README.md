# Face Recognition Project

## Overview

This project is the outcome of a 9-week structured program that began with Python foundations and progressed into real-time face detection and recognition using machine learning and computer vision. The goal was to build a practical understanding of how intelligent systems process, analyze, and identify faces in real-world environments.

By combining libraries like NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, and scikit-learn with techniques such as regression, gradient descent, and face embeddings, this project culminates in a functional, interactive face recognition engine.

## Objectives

- Strengthen Python fundamentals for ML applications.
- Learn data analysis and visualization using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Understand core ML algorithms: linear regression, gradient descent.
- Build real-time face detection using OpenCV and Haar cascades.
- Train face recognition models using Dlib or FaceNet embeddings.
- Design a basic GUI for interaction and live video labeling.
