# Python Libraries Summary â€“ NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

This week, I focused on learning three foundational Python libraries widely used in data science and analysis: NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. I used official documentation and curated video tutorials to understand their concepts, features, and practical usage.

---

## NumPy

- Learned how to use NumPy for numerical operations and array processing.
- Explored the creation and manipulation of 1D, 2D, and multi-dimensional arrays.
- Studied operations such as indexing, slicing, reshaping, and broadcasting.
- Understood how to perform vectorized computations and basic linear algebra.
- Followed both beginner and quickstart documentation along with a video tutorial.

## Pandas

- Gained hands-on knowledge of working with datasets using Pandas.
- Learned about key data structures: Series and DataFrames.
- Performed data operations like filtering, sorting, grouping, and merging.
- Practiced data cleaning and handling of missing values.
- Navigated through Pandas documentation and video tutorials to explore both basic and advanced functionalities.

## Matplotlib

- Learned how to create basic plots using Matplotlib.
- Explored various plot types including line plots, bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots.
- Customized plots with titles, labels, legends, and grid lines.
- Understood the role of Matplotlib as a low-level but highly flexible visualization library.
- Supplemented documentation study with visual examples from a Hindi video tutorial.
