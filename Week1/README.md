# Python Learning Summary â€“ Week 1 (Telusko Series)

This week, I followed the [Python Tutorial for Beginners by Telusko](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsyeobzWxl7poL9JTVyndKe62ieoN-MZ3), which offered a complete walkthrough of core Python concepts and an introduction to Django. Below is a concise summary of what I covered.

---

## Python Fundamentals

- Set up Python using IDLE and PyCharm.
- Wrote basic scripts using `print()`, `input()`, and arithmetic operations.
- Learned about variables, data types, and type conversions.

---

## Control Flow and Functions

- Used `if`, `elif`, `else`, `while`, and `for` to control program flow.
- Defined functions with arguments and return values.
- Implemented recursive functions such as factorial and Fibonacci.

---

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Created classes and objects with constructors (`__init__`) and the `self` keyword.
- Applied inheritance, method overriding, and encapsulation in examples.
- Built small programs using OOP principles.

---

## File Handling and Exceptions

- Opened, read from, and wrote to files using Python's file I/O methods.
- Handled errors using `try`, `except`, and created custom exceptions.

---

## Advanced Python Concepts

- Used lambda functions, list comprehensions, and higher-order functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.
- Explored decorators, generators, and modular code with packages and modules.

---

## SQL with Python

- Learned SQL basics: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
- Used the `sqlite3` module to connect Python to databases.
- Created tables, executed queries, and fetched results.

---

## Django (Introduction)

- Installed Django and created a project and application.
- Built views, mapped URLs, and rendered templates.
